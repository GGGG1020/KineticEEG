# KineticEEG
KineticEEG is a library that detects movments in eeg data. It currently uses the Emotiv headset(see www.emotiv.com). 
It has classifiers as well as tools for preprocessing and getting data. In the future, there are plans to make this a standalone library/ user program. Two approaches that I took are present in this repository. One is listed under the branch called Shapes, and the other is listed under TrainingBank
